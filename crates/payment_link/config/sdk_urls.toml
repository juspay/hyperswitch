# SDK URL Configuration for Payment Link WASM Builds
# 
# Used ONLY for WASM builds - read at compile-time by build.rs and embedded into the WASM binary.
# Router uses different SDK URLs from config/*.toml files (can be overridden by env vars at runtime).
#
# We don't use router's configs because build.rs cannot replicate router's complex runtime 
# configuration resolution (TOML + env var overrides). This simplified config only needs 
# the ENVIRONMENT env var to select the appropriate SDK URL.
#
# Usage: ENVIRONMENT=integ wasm-pack build --features wasm --target web
# Environments must match router_env::Env enum: development, integ, sandbox, production
