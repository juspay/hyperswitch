/// Payments - Create
///
/// **Creates a payment object when amount and currency are passed.** This API is also used to create a mandate by passing the `mandate_object`.
///
/// To completely process a payment you will have to create a payment, attach a payment method, confirm and capture funds.
///
/// Depending on the user journey you wish to achieve, you may opt to complete all the steps in a single request by attaching a payment method, setting `confirm=true` and `capture_method = automatic` in the *Payments/Create API* request or you could use the following sequence of API requests to achieve the same:
///
/// 1. Payments - Create
///
/// 2. Payments - Update
///
/// 3. Payments - Confirm
///
/// 4. Payments - Capture.
///
/// Use the client secret returned in this API along with your publishable key to make subsequent API calls from your client
