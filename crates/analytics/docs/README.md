## Starting the Containers

Docker Compose can be used to start all the components.

Run the following command:

```bash
docker compose --profile olap up -d
```
This will spawn up the following services
1. kafka
2. clickhouse
3. opensearch

## Setting up Kafka

Kafka-UI is a visual tool for inspecting Kafka and it can be accessed at `localhost:8090` to view topics, partitions, consumers & generated events.

## Setting up Clickhouse

Once Clickhouse is up and running, you can interact with it via web.

You can either visit the URL (`http://localhost:8123/play`) where the Clickhouse server is running to get a playground, or you can bash into the Clickhouse container and execute commands manually.

Run the following commands:

```bash
# On your local terminal
docker compose exec clickhouse-server bash

# Inside the clickhouse-server container shell
clickhouse-client --user default

# Inside the clickhouse-client shell
SHOW TABLES;
```

## Configuring Analytics and Events Source

To use Clickhouse and Kafka, you need to enable the `analytics.source` and update the `events.source` in the configuration file.

You can do this in either the `config/development.toml` or `config/docker_compose.toml` file.

Here's an example of how to do this:

```toml
[analytics]
source = "clickhouse"

[events]
source = "kafka"
```

After making this change, save the file and restart your application for the changes to take effect.

## Enabling Data Features in Dashboard

To check the data features in the dashboard, you need to enable them in the `config/dashboard.toml` configuration file.

Here's an example of how to do this:

```toml
[default.features]
audit_trail=true
system_metrics=true
```
