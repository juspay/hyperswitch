## Current Documentation Focus: Memory Bank Finalization and Optimization

Current documentation efforts are centered on two key initiatives:

### 1. Memory Bank Finalization
- Reviewing and updating core files: `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`.
- Ensuring all thematic overviews (e.g., for crates like `scheduler`, `hyperswitch_connectors`, etc.) are consistent and up-to-date with the latest project understanding.
- Verifying the comprehensiveness of `crateIndex.md`.

### 2. File Size Management Implementation
- Implementing the file size management guidelines established in the `.clinerules` file
- Identifying and restructuring documentation files that exceed or approach the 300-line threshold
- Applying appropriate splitting patterns (hierarchical, topic-based, or temporal) based on content structure
- Creating streamlined overview files with links to detailed documentation 
- Ensuring all documentation remains accessible and navigable after splitting

This dual focus aims to solidify the Memory Bank as a reliable foundation for ongoing development while also optimizing its structure for maintainability and AI model processing efficiency.

18. **currency_conversion**: Currency conversion operations with precision decimal arithmetic and ISO standards support (completed 2025-05-20).

## Current Development Focus (Hyperswitch Project)

Based on the open files and project structure, the Hyperswitch project's current development focus remains on:

### Payment Processing Core
- Payment flows (authorization, capture, confirmation).
- Payment methods integration (particularly cards).
- Connector implementations (e.g., Stripe, Square).
- Database interactions and models.

### Version 2 Development
Active development of Version 2 (v2) components, including:
- Customer v2
- Payment methods v2
- Refunds v2
- Various other v2 components, suggesting a significant platform update.

### Router Enhancements
The central `router` component is being enhanced with:
- Improved payment routing logic.
- Better error handling.
- Enhanced connector integrations.
- Performance optimizations.

## Recent Changes and Developments

1.  **Memory Bank Update**: `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` have been reviewed and updated to reflect the current project status and the ongoing Memory Bank finalization efforts.
2.  **File Size Management Implementation**: Proactively implemented file size management for the `router` crate documentation, splitting the monolithic overview into a hierarchical structure with dedicated sections for modules, flows, architecture, and configuration.
3.  **Documentation Structure Optimization**: Updated the file size management guide and implementation tracker with completed work and future targets for documentation restructuring.
4.  **Connector Integrations**: Ongoing implementation and refinement of payment processor integrations (e.g., Stripe, Square).
5.  **Payment Operations**: Enhancements to payment capture and confirmation operations.
6.  **Database Models**: Updates to database models and query functionality using Diesel ORM.
7.  **API Interfaces**: Refinements to API interfaces and models.
8.  **Core Payment Flows**: Improvements to payment flows, particularly the authorization flow.

## Current Challenges

### Hyperswitch Project Challenges
1.  **Connector Compatibility**: Ensuring consistent behavior across different payment processors.
2.  **Database Performance**: Optimizing database queries for high throughput.
3.  **Error Handling**: Implementing robust error handling and recovery.
4.  **Versioning**: Managing the transition between v1 and v2 components.
5.  **Security**: Maintaining high security standards for payment processing.

### Memory Bank Challenges
1.  **Maintaining Accuracy**: Ensuring all Memory Bank documents are kept current with the rapid pace of Hyperswitch development.
2.  **Completeness**: Ensuring all relevant aspects of the project are adequately covered.
3.  **Structural Optimization**: Balancing comprehensive content with maintainable document sizes and effective organization.
4.  **Navigation Coherence**: Maintaining clear navigation paths when splitting documents into smaller, more focused files.

## Next Steps and Roadmap

### Memory Bank Optimization (Immediate Focus)
1.  **Core File Review**: Complete the review and finalization of `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, and `techContext.md`.
2.  **Thematic Overview Review**: Ensure all thematic overviews (especially crate overviews) are consistent, accurate, and reflect the latest project state.
3.  **Index Verification**: Confirm `crateIndex.md` is comprehensive and correctly links to all crate overviews.
4.  **Structural Review**: Assess if any new thematic subfolders are needed or if any content should be moved to the `archive`.
5.  **Continue File Size Management**: Identify and optimize other large documentation files following the established patterns.
6.  **Establish Maintenance Cadence**: Define a process for regular review and updates to the Memory Bank post-finalization.
