## Flow Diagrams

[Include sequence diagrams or flowcharts for complex flows. Use Mermaid syntax for diagrams.]

### [Flow Name 1] Sequence Diagram

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant API
    participant Service
    participant Database
    
    Client->>API: Request operation
    API->>Service: Process operation
    Service->>Database: Store data
    Database-->>Service: Confirm storage
    Service-->>API: Return result
    API-->>Client: Return response
```

### [Flow Name 2] Flowchart
