## Overview

This guide explains how to effectively use the documentation templates provided in this directory. These templates are designed to ensure consistency, completeness, and quality across all Hyperswitch documentation. They provide structured frameworks that can be adapted to specific documentation needs while maintaining a cohesive style across the project.

## Available Templates

The following templates are available:

1. **[Crate Overview Template](crate_overview_template.md)**: For documenting individual crates
2. **[Flow Documentation Template](flow_documentation_template.md)**: For documenting process flows
3. **[API Documentation Template](api_documentation_template.md)**: For documenting APIs and endpoints
4. **[Configuration Documentation Template](configuration_documentation_template.md)**: For documenting configuration options
5. **[Implementation Guide Template](implementation_guide_template.md)**: For creating implementation guides

## When to Use Each Template

### Crate Overview Template

**Use when:**
- Documenting a new crate
- Updating documentation for an existing crate
- Creating a comprehensive overview of a crate's purpose, structure, and usage

**Key sections to focus on:**
- Purpose: Clearly articulate what problems the crate solves
- Key Modules: Break down the crate's internal structure
- Public Interface: Document the primary ways other code interacts with this crate
- Usage Examples: Provide concrete examples showing how to use the crate
- Integration with Other Crates: Explain how this crate fits into the broader ecosystem

### Flow Documentation Template

**Use when:**
- Documenting complex processes that span multiple components
- Explaining sequences of operations and their interactions
- Describing data flows through the system
- Documenting error handling and retry strategies

**Key sections to focus on:**
- Overview: Provide context for why these flows exist
- Key Flows: Document each flow step-by-step
- Flow Diagrams: Visualize complex interactions
- Error Handling: Explain how errors are managed
- Edge Cases: Document non-standard scenarios

### API Documentation Template

**Use when:**
- Documenting REST APIs or internal service interfaces
- Creating reference material for API consumers
- Explaining request/response formats and error codes

**Key sections to focus on:**
- Endpoints: Document each API endpoint with all parameters
- Request/Response Examples: Show real-world examples
- Error Codes: Explain all possible errors
- Authentication: Detail security requirements
- Versioning: Explain API versioning strategy

### Configuration Documentation Template

**Use when:**
- Documenting configuration options for a component
- Explaining environment variables, config files, and their effects
- Providing guidance on configuration for different environments

**Key sections to focus on:**
- Configuration Sources: Document all ways configuration can be provided
- Core Configuration Options: Detail each configuration parameter
- Validation Rules: Explain constraints on configuration values
- Environment-Specific Configurations: Provide examples for different contexts
- Troubleshooting: Address common configuration issues

### Implementation Guide Template

**Use when:**
- Providing step-by-step instructions for implementing features
- Creating guides for extending or integrating with the system
- Documenting best practices for implementation

**Key sections to focus on:**
- Prerequisites: Clearly state what's needed before starting
- Implementation Steps: Provide detailed, sequential instructions
- Testing Strategy: Explain how to verify the implementation
- Best Practices: Share recommendations based on experience
- Troubleshooting: Address common implementation problems

## Template Customization Guidelines

1. **Retain the Core Structure**: Keep the main sections and hierarchy to maintain consistency
2. **Add Sections as Needed**: Include additional sections for component-specific details
3. **Remove Irrelevant Sections**: Don't include empty sections - remove those that don't apply
4. **Adapt the Level of Detail**: Scale the depth based on complexity and importance
5. **Use Consistent Formatting**: Follow the established formatting patterns

## Documentation Writing Best Practices

### Clarity and Accessibility

1. **Start with Purpose**: Always begin by explaining why the documented component exists
2. **Use Simple Language**: Avoid jargon and complex sentences
3. **Define Terms**: Explain domain-specific terminology
4. **Link to Prerequisites**: Don't repeat information - link to it
5. **Consider the Audience**: Write for the expected knowledge level of readers

### Content Quality

1. **Be Accurate**: Verify all technical details
2. **Be Complete**: Cover all important aspects
3. **Be Concise**: Value clarity and brevity
4. **Use Examples**: Include realistic, working examples
5. **Update Promptly**: Keep documentation in sync with code changes

### Visual Elements

1. **Use Tables** for structured data and parameters
2. **Use Code Blocks** with syntax highlighting for code examples
3. **Use Diagrams** for complex flows and relationships
4. **Use Lists** for sequential steps and collections of items
5. **Use Headings** to create a clear hierarchy

## Template Completion Process

1. **Select Template**: Choose the appropriate template for your documentation need
2. **Copy Template**: Create a new file in the appropriate location based on the template
3. **Fill Required Metadata**: Update the header with accurate date and status
4. **Complete Core Sections**: Focus on the most important sections first
5. **Add Examples**: Include concrete, tested examples
6. **Review**: Check for accuracy, completeness, and clarity
7. **Link**: Add cross-references to related documentation
8. **Commit**: Submit documentation changes along with code

## Metadata Fields Explained

Each template includes standard metadata fields:

- **Last Updated**: The date when the document was last modified (format: YYYY-MM-DD)
- **Documentation Status**: One of:
  - **Initial**: Basic documentation, may have gaps
  - **Expanded**: Comprehensive coverage of main topics
  - **Complete**: Thorough documentation with examples and edge cases
- **Parent**: Link to the parent document in the documentation hierarchy
- **Related Files**: Links to closely related documentation

## Examples of Well-Documented Components

For reference, here are examples of well-documented components in the Hyperswitch ecosystem:

- [Router Crate Overview](/Users/arunraj/github/hyperswitch/memory-bank/thematic/crates/router/overview.md)
- [Payment Flows Documentation](/Users/arunraj/github/hyperswitch/memory-bank/thematic/crates/router/flows/payment_flows.md)
- [Common Utils Crate Documentation](/Users/arunraj/github/hyperswitch/memory-bank/thematic/crates/common_utils/overview.md)

## Documentation Review Checklist

Before finalizing documentation, verify:

- [ ] All required sections are completed
- [ ] Metadata is accurate and up-to-date
- [ ] Examples are functional and follow best practices
- [ ] Links to other documentation are valid
- [ ] Technical information is accurate
- [ ] Writing is clear and accessible
- [ ] Formatting is consistent with other documentation
- [ ] Document is free of spelling and grammatical errors

## Template Maintenance

These templates should be reviewed and updated periodically to ensure they remain aligned with project needs and best practices. If you identify improvements that could be made to the templates, please update them accordingly.
