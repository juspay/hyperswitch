## Time Allocation Guidelines

To ensure quality reviews, participants should allocate sufficient time:

- **Initial Review**: 30-60 minutes per document, depending on length and complexity

- **Final Review**: 30-60 minutes per document
- **Revision**: Variable, depending on the extent of feedback

These are guidelines and may vary based on document complexity.
