# Documentation Review Checklists

## Overview

This document provides practical checklists for different types of documentation reviews. These checklists are based on the criteria defined in the [Review Criteria](02_review_criteria.md) document and are designed to streamline the review process by providing a structured approach to evaluating documentation.

## How to Use These Checklists

1. Select the appropriate checklist based on the document type and review stage
2. Work through each item in the checklist methodically
3. Mark items as Pass, Fail, or N/A (not applicable)
4. For any failed items, provide specific feedback with examples
5. Use the severity guide to prioritize issues
