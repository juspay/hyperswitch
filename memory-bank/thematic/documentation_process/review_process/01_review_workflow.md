## Special Considerations

### Expedited Reviews

For urgent documentation needs, an expedited review process is available:

1. Author requests expedited review with justification
2. Documentation lead assigns priority reviewers
3. Reviews are completed within 1 business day per stage
4. Final approval may be conditional with follow-up review

### Documentation Dependencies

When documentation has dependencies on other documents:

1. Identify all dependent documents
2. Consider reviewing documents as a set
3. Ensure cross-references are updated consistently
4. Verify that changes don't create inconsistencies

## Review Process Governance

The documentation review process is overseen by:

- **Documentation Lead**: Responsible for the overall process and final approvals
- **Technical Reviewers**: Subject matter experts who verify technical accuracy
- **Style Reviewers**: Ensure consistency and adherence to documentation standards

The process itself should be reviewed quarterly and updated as needed based on feedback and changing project needs.
