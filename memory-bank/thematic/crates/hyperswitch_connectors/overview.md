# Hyperswitch Connectors Crate Overview

The `hyperswitch_connectors` crate is a fundamental component of the Hyperswitch payment orchestration platform, responsible for integrating with various payment processors (connectors). This document provides an overview of the connectors crate's structure, responsibilities, and key components.

## Purpose

The hyperswitch_connectors crate serves as the integration layer between Hyperswitch and external payment processors. Its main responsibilities include:

1. **API Integration**: Implementing the API integrations with payment processors
2. **Request Transformation**: Converting Hyperswitch's standardized requests into connector-specific formats
3. **Response Transformation**: Converting connector-specific responses into Hyperswitch's standardized format
4. **Error Handling**: Managing and standardizing error responses from connectors
5. **Authentication**: Implementing connector-specific authentication mechanisms
6. **Webhook Processing**: Handling incoming webhooks from connectors

## Architecture

The connectors crate follows a modular architecture where each connector is implemented as a separate module. This design allows for:

1. **Isolation**: Each connector's implementation is isolated from others
2. **Extensibility**: New connectors can be added without modifying existing ones
3. **Maintainability**: Connector-specific changes are contained within their respective modules
4. **Standardization**: All connectors adhere to common interfaces and patterns

## Key Components

### Connector Trait

The `Connector` trait defines the interface that all connector implementations must adhere to. It includes methods for:

- **Payment Operations**: Authorization, capture, void, refund, etc.
- **Authentication**: Handling connector authentication
- **Webhook Processing**: Processing incoming webhooks
- **Metadata Handling**: Managing connector-specific metadata

### Connector Implementations

Each connector implementation includes:

- **API Client**: For making HTTP requests to the connector's API
- **Request Builders**: For constructing connector-specific requests
- **Response Parsers**: For parsing connector responses
- **Error Handlers**: For handling connector-specific errors
- **Transformers**: For data transformation between Hyperswitch and connector formats

### Common Utilities

The crate provides common utilities for connector implementations:

- **HTTP Client**: A shared HTTP client for making API requests
- **Authentication Utilities**: Helpers for implementing various authentication schemes
- **Error Handling**: Standardized error handling mechanisms
- **Validation**: Request validation utilities
- **Encryption/Decryption**: Utilities for secure data handling

## Supported Connectors

The crate supports a wide range of payment processors, including:

1. **Major Payment Processors**:
   - Stripe
   - Square
   - Adyen
   - PayPal
   - Checkout.com
   - Worldpay
   - Cybersource

2. **Regional Payment Processors**:
   - Mollie (Europe)
   - Klarna (Europe)
   - Paytm (India)
   - Razorpay (India)
   - Mercado Pago (Latin America)
   - Alipay (China)
   - WeChat Pay (China)

3. **Alternative Payment Methods**:
   - Digital Wallets (Apple Pay, Google Pay)
   - Bank Transfers
   - Buy Now Pay Later (Affirm, Afterpay)
   - Cryptocurrency

## Connector Implementation Pattern

Each connector follows a standard implementation pattern:

### Module Structure

```
connectors/
└── connector_name/
    ├── mod.rs              # Main module file
    ├── transformers.rs     # Request/response transformers
    ├── utils.rs            # Connector-specific utilities
    └── tests/              # Connector tests
```

### Implementation Components

1. **Connector Struct**: Implements the Connector trait
2. **API Types**: Defines connector-specific request/response types
3. **Transformers**: Implements data transformation logic
4. **Error Mapping**: Maps connector errors to standardized errors
5. **Webhook Handlers**: Processes incoming webhooks

## Key Workflows

### Payment Authorization Flow

1. Hyperswitch creates a standardized payment authorization request
2. The connector transformer converts it to the connector's format
3. The request is sent to the connector's API
4. The connector's response is received and parsed
5. The response is transformed back to Hyperswitch's format
6. The standardized response is returned to Hyperswitch

### Webhook Processing Flow

1. A webhook is received from a connector
2. The webhook is routed to the appropriate connector handler
3. The handler validates the webhook signature
4. The webhook payload is parsed and transformed
5. The standardized webhook event is returned to Hyperswitch

## Error Handling

The connectors crate implements comprehensive error handling:

1. **Connector-specific Errors**: Each connector defines its specific error types
2. **Error Mapping**: Connector errors are mapped to standardized Hyperswitch errors
3. **Error Context**: Additional context is added to errors for debugging
4. **Retry Logic**: Certain errors trigger automatic retries

## Testing

The connectors crate includes extensive testing:

1. **Unit Tests**: Tests for individual components
2. **Integration Tests**: Tests for connector integrations
3. **Mock Servers**: Mock servers for testing without actual API calls
4. **Sandbox Testing**: Tests against connector sandbox environments

## Adding a New Connector

Adding a new connector involves:

1. **Create Module**: Create a new module for the connector
2. **Define Types**: Define connector-specific request/response types
3. **Implement Transformers**: Implement request/response transformers
4. **Implement Connector Trait**: Implement the Connector trait
5. **Add Error Mapping**: Map connector errors to standardized errors
6. **Add Tests**: Add tests for the connector implementation
7. **Update Registry**: Register the connector in the connector registry

## Integration with Other Crates

The connectors crate integrates with several other crates in the Hyperswitch ecosystem:

1. **router**: Uses connectors for payment processing
2. **hyperswitch_domain_models**: Provides domain models for transformations
3. **common_utils**: Provides utility functions
4. **common_enums**: Provides shared enumerations
5. **masking**: Provides data masking capabilities

## Performance Considerations

The connectors crate is designed for high performance:

- **Connection Pooling**: Reuses HTTP connections for efficiency
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Uses async/await for non-blocking operations
- **Efficient Transformations**: Minimizes data copying during transformations
- **Caching**: Caches frequently used data (e.g., authentication tokens)

## Security Considerations

The connectors crate implements several security measures:

- **Credential Management**: Securely manages connector credentials
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypts sensitive data
- **PCI Compliance**: Follows PCI DSS guidelines for handling card data
- **Webhook Validation**: Validates webhook signatures
- **TLS**: Uses TLS for secure communication

## Conclusion

The hyperswitch_connectors crate is a critical component of the Hyperswitch platform, enabling integration with a wide range of payment processors. Its modular architecture allows for easy extension and maintenance, while its standardized interfaces ensure consistent behavior across different connectors.
