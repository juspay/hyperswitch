## Overview

The `services` module provides various helper services used across the Hyperswitch application. These services abstract common operations, encapsulate complexity, and offer interfaces to external systems. They typically act as bridges between the router's core business logic and other crates or external systems.

## Key Components

### API Services

The API services handle operations related to API functionality:

- **Request Validation**: Validates incoming API requests
- **Response Formatting**: Ensures consistent API response formatting
- **API Version Management**: Handles differences between API versions
- **API Metadata Services**: Provides information about available API operations

### Authentication Services

Authentication services manage merchant identity verification:

- **API Key Verification**: Validates API keys for incoming requests
- **Key Management**: Services for creating, rotating, and revoking API keys
- **Authentication Strategies**: Implements different authentication methods (Bearer token, OAuth, etc.)
- **Multi-tenant Support**: Ensures proper merchant isolation for multi-tenant deployments

### Authorization Services

Authorization services handle access control for API operations:

- **Permission Checking**: Verifies if authenticated merchants have permission for specific operations
- **Role-based Access Control**: Implements role-based permissions
- **Scoped Permissions**: Controls access to specific resources
- **Audit Logging**: Records authorization decisions for security auditing

### Database Services

Database services abstract interactions with the database:

- **Query Building**: Constructs database queries
- **Transaction Management**: Handles database transaction boundaries
- **Connection Pooling**: Manages database connection pools
- **Result Mapping**: Maps database results to domain models

> **Note:** While some direct database logic currently exists here, architecturally, these responsibilities are intended to be fully managed by the `storage_impl` crate, which serves as the canonical data access layer. Over time, logic from the DB services is expected to migrate to `storage_impl`.

### Redis Services

Redis services provide interfaces for Redis operations:

- **Caching**: Implements caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data
- **Distributed Locks**: Provides distributed locking capabilities
- **Rate Limiting**: Implements rate limiting using Redis
- **Session State**: Manages temporary session state
- **Pub/Sub**: Interfaces for Redis publish/subscribe messaging

These services utilize the `redis_interface` crate for the actual Redis communication.

### Connector Services

Connector services facilitate interaction with payment processors:

- **Connector Selection**: Services to select appropriate payment connectors
- **Request Building**: Builds connector-specific API requests
- **Response Processing**: Processes and normalizes connector responses
- **Error Handling**: Handles connector-specific errors and retry logic
- **Configuration Management**: Manages connector credentials and settings

### Health Services

Health services support system monitoring and health checks:

- **System Health**: Checks overall system health
- **Dependency Health**: Verifies dependencies (database, Redis, etc.) are operational
- **Performance Metrics**: Collects performance data
- **Resource Usage**: Monitors system resource usage

### Notification Services

Notification services handle various notification mechanisms:

- **Email Services**: Sends email notifications
- **Webhook Delivery**: Manages outgoing webhook delivery
- **Alert Services**: Generates system alerts
- **Notification Templates**: Manages templates for different notification types

## Implementation Patterns

The services module follows several key implementation patterns:

### Service Interface Pattern

Services typically define interfaces (traits) that allow for:

- Clear separation of concerns
- Testability through mock implementations
- Dependency injection
- Potential for alternative implementations

### Dependency Injection

Services are typically constructed with their dependencies and injected where needed:

```rust
pub struct PaymentService {
    db_service: Arc<dyn DatabaseService>,
    connector_service: Arc<dyn ConnectorService>,
    redis_service: Arc<dyn RedisService>,
}
```

### Asynchronous Design

Services are predominantly designed for asynchronous operation:

```rust
pub async fn process_payment(&self, payment_data: PaymentData) -> Result<PaymentResponse, Error> {
    // Asynchronous operations
}
```

### Error Handling

Services implement consistent error handling patterns:

- Errors are mapped to appropriate domain errors
- Error contexts are preserved
- Service-specific errors are defined when necessary

## Dependencies

The services module interacts with several other crates:

- **`storage_impl`**: For database access
- **`redis_interface`**: For Redis operations
- **`api_models`**: For API data structures
- **`hyperswitch_domain_models`**: For domain-specific entities and operations
- **`hyperswitch_connectors`**: For payment connector integrations
