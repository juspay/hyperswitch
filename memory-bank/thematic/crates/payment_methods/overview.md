## Usage Examples

### Creating a Payment Method

```rust
use payment_methods::controller::PaymentMethodsController;
use api_models::payment_methods::{PaymentMethodCreate, PaymentMethodResponse};

async fn add_payment_method(
    pm_controller: &impl PaymentMethodsController,
    req: PaymentMethodCreate
) -> Result<PaymentMethodResponse, Error> {
    let payment_method_response = pm_controller.add_payment_method(&req).await?;
    Ok(payment_method_response)
}
```

### Retrieving a Payment Method

```rust
use payment_methods::controller::PaymentMethodsController;
use api_models::payment_methods::{PaymentMethodId, PaymentMethodResponse};

async fn get_payment_method(
    pm_controller: &impl PaymentMethodsController,
    pm_id: PaymentMethodId
) -> Result<PaymentMethodResponse, Error> {
    let payment_method = pm_controller.retrieve_payment_method(pm_id).await?;
    Ok(payment_method)
}
```

### Deleting a Payment Method

```rust
use payment_methods::controller::PaymentMethodsController;
use api_models::payment_methods::{PaymentMethodId, PaymentMethodDeleteResponse};

async fn delete_payment_method(
    pm_controller: &impl PaymentMethodsController,
    pm_id: PaymentMethodId
) -> Result<PaymentMethodDeleteResponse, Error> {
    let response = pm_controller.delete_payment_method(pm_id).await?;
    Ok(response)
}
```

### Adding a Card with Locker Integration

```rust
use payment_methods::controller::PaymentMethodsController;
use api_models::{payment_methods::{PaymentMethodCreate, CardDetail}, enums::LockerChoice};
use common_utils::id_type::CustomerId;

async fn add_card(
    pm_controller: &impl PaymentMethodsController,
    req: PaymentMethodCreate,
    card: CardDetail,
    customer_id: CustomerId
) -> Result<PaymentMethodResponse, Error> {
    let (response, duplication_check) = pm_controller
        .add_card_to_locker(req, &card, &customer_id, None)
        .await?;
    
    Ok(response)
}
```

## Integration with Other Crates

The `payment_methods` crate integrates with several other components of the Hyperswitch ecosystem:

1. **api_models**: Uses API models for payment method request and response structures
2. **common_enums**: Uses common enumerations for payment method types and status values
3. **common_types**: Integrates with common type definitions
4. **hyperswitch_domain_models**: Uses domain models for payment method entities
5. **masking**: Uses masking utilities for securing sensitive data
6. **storage_impl**: Uses storage implementation for persisting payment methods

## Feature Flags
