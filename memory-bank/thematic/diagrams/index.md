This directory contains comprehensive visual documentation of the Hyperswitch payment orchestration platform architecture and workflows. These diagrams provide different views and levels of detail to help understand the system structure, interactions, and processes.

## Available Diagrams

| Diagram Type | Purpose | Best For |
|--------------|---------|----------|
| [System Architecture](./system_architecture_diagram.md) | Shows the high-level system components and their relationships | Understanding the overall system structure |
| [Component Interaction](./component_interaction_diagram.md) | Illustrates how components interact during key operations | Understanding communication patterns between components |
| [Data Flow](./data_flow_diagram.md) | Visualizes how data moves through the system | Understanding data transformations and storage |
| [State Transition](./state_transition_diagram.md) | Shows the possible states and transitions for key entities | Understanding process lifecycles and state management |
| [Sequence Diagrams](./sequence_diagrams.md) | Provides detailed step-by-step sequences for complex flows | Understanding detailed implementation of specific processes |

## How to Use These Diagrams

These diagrams are designed to be used together to provide a comprehensive understanding of the Hyperswitch system:

1. **Start with the System Architecture Diagram** to understand the overall structure and major components of the system.

2. **Use the Component Interaction Diagram** to see how these components communicate during key operations like payment processing or refunds.

3. **Refer to the Data Flow Diagram** to understand how data is transformed and stored as it moves through the system.

4. **Consult the State Transition Diagram** to understand the possible states and transitions for payments, refunds, and webhooks.

5. **Use the Sequence Diagrams** for detailed implementation-level understanding of specific complex flows.

## Diagram Standards

All diagrams in this directory adhere to the following standards:

- **Mermaid Syntax**: All diagrams use Mermaid syntax for consistency and maintainability
- **Color Coding**: Consistent color schemes across diagrams (e.g., external systems, internal components, data stores)
- **Naming Conventions**: Consistent component and entity naming across all diagrams
- **Documentation**: Each diagram includes detailed explanations and annotations

## Updating Diagrams

When making changes to the system architecture or workflows, these diagrams should be updated to reflect the changes. Please adhere to the following guidelines:

1. Maintain consistent terminology and naming across all diagrams
2. Preserve the existing color schemes and styling
3. Update the "Last Updated" timestamp at the top of the file
4. Add explanatory notes for significant changes
