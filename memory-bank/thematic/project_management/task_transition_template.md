# Task Transition Template

This template should be used when creating a new task that continues from a previous one. It ensures continuity and knowledge preservation by providing comprehensive context.

## Current Work
[Provide a detailed description of what you have been working on and what has been completed. This should give the next agent a clear understanding of the current state of the task.]

Example:
```
I've completed the documentation for the `common_enums` crate, including a comprehensive overview of its purpose, key modules, and integration with other parts of the system. I've also updated all relevant reference files including `crateIndex.md`, `progress.md`, and `finalization_review_pending.md`.
```

## Key Technical Concepts
[List the important technical concepts, patterns, decisions, and architectural elements that are relevant to this work. This ensures technical context is preserved.]

Example:
```
- **Memory Bank Structure**: Follows hierarchical organization with core files and thematic subfolders
- **Documentation Approach**: Crate overviews use a standard template covering purpose, modules, configuration, examples, etc.
- **File Size Management**: Files exceeding 300 lines should be split according to the guidelines in .clinerules
```

## Relevant Files and Code
[List all the important files that have been created, modified, or are relevant to the next steps, along with brief descriptions of their purpose or state.]

Example:
```
- `/Users/arunraj/github/hyperswitch/memory-bank/thematic/crates/common_enums/overview.md` (newly created document)
- `/Users/arunraj/github/hyperswitch/memory-bank/crateIndex.md` (updated with link to the new document)
- `/Users/arunraj/github/hyperswitch/memory-bank/finalization_review_pending.md` (updated to mark common_enums as completed)
```

## Problem Solving
[Describe any challenging problems that were solved, approaches that were tried, or insights gained during the work.]

Example:
```
I developed a systematic approach for analyzing crates:
1. Examine the crate structure and key files
2. Identify dependencies and relationships
3. Map out the key components and their functionality
4. Organize information according to the standard template
```

## Next Steps
[Clearly define the next steps that should be taken to continue the task, in order of priority.]

Example:
```
1. Document the `common_types` crate following the same approach
2. Perform a file size audit starting with `systemPatterns.md` and `techContext.md`
3. Apply the splitting strategy to any files exceeding size guidelines
4. Update the implementation tracker with progress
```

## References
[Include any external references, documentation, or resources that are relevant to continuing the task.]

Example:
```
- Memory Bank Generation Plan: `/Users/arunraj/github/hyperswitch/memory-bank/thematic/documentation_process/memory_bank_generation_plan.md`
- Implementation Tracker: `/Users/arunraj/github/hyperswitch/memory-bank/thematic/project_management/implementation_tracker.md`
- File Size Management Guidelines: See .clinerules file
```
