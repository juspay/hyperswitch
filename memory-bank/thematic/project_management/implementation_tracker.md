# Implementation Tracker

This document tracks the implementation status of key initiatives and tasks in the Hyperswitch project, ensuring continuity across different work sessions and tasks.

## Active Initiatives

| Initiative | Description | Status | Last Updated | Next Steps |
|------------|-------------|--------|--------------|------------|
| Memory Bank Finalization | Complete documentation for all crates | In Progress | 2025-05-20 | Document remaining crates from `finalization_review_pending.md` |
| File Size Management | Apply new size guidelines to existing docs | In Progress | 2025-05-20 | Continue analyzing other crate documentation files |
| Knowledge Graph Integration | Implement knowledge graphs for complex crates | Not Started | 2025-05-20 | Start with `router` crate |

## Detailed Status

### Memory Bank Finalization

**Completed Items:**
- Documentation for core crates (`router`, `scheduler`, etc.)
- Documentation for `hyperswitch_domain_models` crate
- Documentation for `common_enums` crate
- Documentation for `common_types` crate
- Documentation for `router_derive` crate
- Documentation for `cards` crate
- Updated `crateIndex.md` with links to new documentation

**Pending Items:**
- Documentation for other crates marked as missing in `finalization_review_pending.md`

**Implementation Notes:**
- Follow the standard template as established in existing crate documentation
- Ensure comprehensive coverage of all key aspects of each crate
- Update reference files after completing each document

### File Size Management

**Implementation Plan:**
1. Audit existing files for size compliance ✓
2. Identify files exceeding 300 lines/15KB ✓
3. Apply splitting strategy as defined in the `.clinerules` file ✓
4. Update cross-references to maintain document coherence ✓

**Completed Files:**
- `systemPatterns.md` - Analyzed, found compliant
- `techContext.md` - Analyzed, found compliant
- `router/overview.md` - Proactively split following hierarchical pattern

**Next Files to Check:**
- `hyperswitch_domain_models/overview.md` - Analyzed, found compliant (around 120 lines)
- `scheduler/overview.md` - Analyzed, found compliant (around 150 lines) 
- Other large crate overview documents

### Knowledge Graph Integration

**Implementation Approach:**
1. Identify core entities in target crates
2. Map relationships between components
3. Generate visualizations and insights
4. Integrate findings into documentation

**Target Crates (in order):**
1. `router` (highest complexity)
2. `hyperswitch_connectors`
3. Other core crates

## Task Transition Guidance

When creating a new task that continues work from this task, ensure the following information is provided:

1. **Current Status:** What has been completed and what remains
2. **Key Decisions:** Important decisions made and their rationale
3. **Open Questions:** Any unresolved questions or issues
4. **File References:** Links to relevant files and documentation
5. **Next Actions:** Specific next steps to be taken

Example transition block:

```
## Current Work
I've completed the implementation of X and updated documentation for Y.

## Key Technical Concepts
- Concept A works by doing B
- Component C integrates with D through mechanism E

## Relevant Files
- `/path/to/file1.md` - Contains implementation details
- `/path/to/file2.md` - Needs updating next

## Next Steps
1. Complete the implementation of Z
2. Update cross-references in file2.md
3. Verify integration with system W
```
