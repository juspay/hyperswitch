# Cross-Reference Update System

This document outlines the systematic approach for identifying, updating, and maintaining cross-references when Memory Bank documentation files are split into smaller units. Cross-reference integrity is critical for preserving the navigability and cohesiveness of the documentation after file size management operations.

## Cross-Reference Types

The Memory Bank documentation contains several types of cross-references that must be managed during file splitting:

### 1. Internal References

References within a single document that is being split:

```markdown
<!-- Original file before splitting -->
# Payment Flows

## Payment Initiation
[details about initiation]

## Payment Processing
As mentioned in the [Payment Initiation](#payment-initiation) section...
```

These become external references after splitting and require special attention.

### 2. External References

References from one document to another:

```markdown
<!-- In webhook_flows.md -->
For more information, see [Payment Flows](../payment_flows.md#payment-processing).
```

These need to be updated when target files are split or reorganized.

### 3. Bidirectional References

Pairs of documents that reference each other:

```markdown
<!-- In payment_flows.md -->
For webhook events, see [Webhook Flows](../webhook_flows.md).

<!-- In webhook_flows.md -->
This webhook is triggered during [Payment Processing](../payment_flows.md#payment-processing).
```

Both references need to be updated when either file is split.

### 4. Index References

References from index or table of contents files:

```markdown
<!-- In documentation_index.md -->
- [Payment Flows](./flows/payment_flows.md)
- [Webhook Flows](./flows/webhook_flows.md)
```

These must be updated to point to the new index files after splitting.

## Cross-Reference Update Process

### 1. Reference Identification

Before splitting any file:

1. **Scan for Inbound References**
   - Use the search tool to find all files that reference the target file
   - Example command:
     ```bash
     grep -r "payment_flows.md" --include="*.md" /Users/arunraj/github/hyperswitch/memory-bank
     ```

2. **Document Internal References**
   - Identify all internal section references within the file being split
   - Map each internal reference to its future location after splitting
   - Example mapping document:
     ```
     Original: #payment-initiation → New: payment-initiation.md
     Original: #payment-processing → New: payment-processing.md
     ```

3. **Create Reference Inventory**
   - Document all references in a structured format:
     ```
     Source File | Reference Type | Target File | Target Anchor | New Target
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     webhook_flows.md | External | payment_flows.md | #payment-processing | ./payment/processing.md
     ```

### 2. Reference Update Planning

For each file to be split:

1. **Develop Update Strategy**
   - Determine whether to update references before, during, or after splitting
   - Choose between automated tools and manual updates
   - Consider the scope of changes (single file vs. multiple files)

2. **Create Update Mapping**
   - Document old and new locations for each section of content
   - Include file paths and anchor references
   - Example:
     ```
     payment_flows.md#payment-initiation → payments/initiation.md
     payment_flows.md#payment-processing → payments/processing.md
     ```

3. **Prioritize Updates**
   - Start with index files and major entry points
   - Update bidirectional references together
   - Consider dependencies between documents

### 3. Reference Update Implementation

Execute the updates in this order:

1. **Update the Split File First**
   - Create the new directory structure
   - Split the content into multiple files
   - Update all internal references to point to new locations

2. **Update Direct Inbound References**
   - Modify all files that directly reference the split file
   - Update both file paths and anchor references
   - Example change:
     ```markdown
     <!-- Old -->
     [Payment Processing](../payment_flows.md#payment-processing)
     
     <!-- New -->
     [Payment Processing](../payments/processing.md)
     ```

3. **Update Index and TOC Files**
   - Modify any index files or tables of contents
   - Update navigation structures and menus
   - Add references to all new component files

4. **Add Redirection Notes**
   - In the overview file, add notes about relocated content
   - Consider adding temporary anchor redirects for common references

### 4. Verification and Testing

After updating all references:

1. **Automated Link Checking**
   - Use link validation tools to identify broken references
   - Example command:
     ```bash
     # Example using a hypothetical link checker
     linkchecker --check-externals --check-anchors /Users/arunraj/github/hyperswitch/memory-bank
     ```

2. **Manual Review**
   - Navigate through the documentation following typical user paths
   - Test navigation from index files to component documents
   - Verify bidirectional references

3. **Fix Any Issues**
   - Address any broken links identified during verification
   - Update any missed references
   - Consider adding additional navigation aids if needed

## Tools and Techniques

### Search and Replace Tools

The following commands can help identify and update references:

1. **Find All References to a File**
   ```bash
   grep -r "payment_flows.md" --include="*.md" /Users/arunraj/github/hyperswitch/memory-bank
   ```

2. **Find Section References Within Files**
   ```bash
   grep -r "#payment-processing" --include="*.md" /Users/arunraj/github/hyperswitch/memory-bank
   ```

3. **Batch Update References**
   ```bash
   # Example of a search and replace command (use with caution)
   find /Users/arunraj/github/hyperswitch/memory-bank -name "*.md" -type f -exec sed -i 's|payment_flows.md#payment-processing|payments/processing.md|g' {} \;
   ```

### Reference Tracking Spreadsheet

Create a spreadsheet with the following columns to track reference updates:

| Source File | Reference Type | Original Reference | New Reference | Status | Notes |
|-------------|----------------|-------------------|---------------|--------|-------|
| webhook_flows.md | External | [Payment Processing](../payment_flows.md#payment-processing) | [Payment Processing](../payments/processing.md) | Updated | Also updated anchor |
| documentation_index.md | Index | [Payment Flows](./flows/payment_flows.md) | [Payment Flows](./flows/payments/overview.md) | Updated | Added links to component files |

### Temporary Redirection Techniques

Consider these techniques to maintain reference integrity during transition:

1. **HTML Redirects (for web-based documentation)**
   ```html
   <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url=./payments/processing.md">
   <p>This page has moved to <a href="./payments/processing.md">Processing</a>.</p>
   ```

2. **Anchor Preservation in Overview Files**
   ```markdown
   # Payment Flows Overview
   
   <a id="payment-processing"></a>
   ## Processing Section
   
   This content has moved to [Payment Processing](./processing.md).
   ```

3. **Reference Maps**
   Create a dedicated document mapping old references to new locations for users familiar with the old structure.

## Case Studies

### Case Study 1: Updating References for Payment Flows

When splitting `payment_flows.md` (617 lines) into component files:

1. **Pre-Split Reference Scan**
   - Found 25 references to `payment_flows.md` in other documents
   - Identified 12 internal section references

2. **Reference Mapping Created**
   ```
   payment_flows.md → payments/overview.md
   payment_flows.md#payment-initiation → payments/initiation.md
   payment_flows.md#payment-processing → payments/processing.md
   payment_flows.md#payment-completion → payments/completion.md
   payment_flows.md#error-handling → payments/error-handling.md
   ```

3. **Update Implementation**
   - Updated the 25 external references in other documents
   - Added anchor redirects in the overview file
   - Updated the documentation index

4. **Results**
   - All 25 external references successfully redirected
   - Navigation maintained through the splitting process
   - User experience preserved with no broken links

### Case Study 2: Updating References for Connector Implementation Guide

When splitting `connector_implementation_guide.md` (702 lines) into multiple files:

1. **Reference Analysis**
   - Found 18 references from other documents
   - Many references to specific sections (anchors)

2. **Special Challenges**
   - Some references needed to point to different files
   - Several bidirectional references with testing documentation

3. **Solution Approach**
   - Created category-based directory structure
   - Updated references in stages (connectors first, then dependent files)
   - Added comprehensive redirects in the overview document

4. **Outcome**
   - Successfully maintained all reference relationships
   - Improved navigability with clearer structure
   - Added cross-references between related components

## Best Practices

### During Initial File Splitting

1. **Use Unique, Stable Section IDs**
   - Create unique IDs for sections likely to be referenced
   - Maintain these IDs when splitting files
   - Example: `<a id="payment-processing"></a>`

2. **Create Comprehensive Indices**
   - Ensure all component files are accessible from indices
   - Include descriptive text with each link
   - Organize links logically (not just alphabetically)

3. **Use Relative Paths**
   - Always use relative paths in references
   - Consider the directory structure when creating references
   - Test references from different locations

### Ongoing Maintenance

1. **Document All Cross-References**
   - Maintain a register of important cross-references
   - Review cross-references during regular documentation updates
   - Use tools to verify reference integrity periodically

2. **Standardize Reference Formats**
   - Use consistent patterns for internal and external references
   - Include descriptive link text (not "click here")
   - Consider including section names in file references

3. **Establish Update Protocols**
   - Define the process for updating references when files change
   - Include reference updates in documentation change reviews
   - Verify references after major documentation restructuring
