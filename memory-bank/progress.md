## Documentation Progress: Memory Bank Finalization

The Hyperswitch Memory Bank is currently undergoing a finalization phase. The goal is to ensure all core and thematic documents are accurate, consistent, and provide a complete, up-to-date snapshot of the project.

### Memory Bank Core Files Status
-   **`projectbrief.md`**: Under final review.
-   **`productContext.md`**: Under final review.
-   **`activeContext.md`**: **Updated** this session to reflect current Memory Bank finalization focus and project status.
-   **`systemPatterns.md`**: Under final review.
-   **`techContext.md`**: Under final review.
-   **`progress.md`**: **Updated** this session to reflect current Memory Bank finalization focus and project status.
-   **`crateIndex.md`**: Believed comprehensive; pending final verification.

### Thematic Documentation Status (Crates)
Detailed overviews for the following crates are drafted and are pending final review for consistency and accuracy as part of the Memory Bank finalization:
1.  **router**: Core payment processing and API handling
2.  **scheduler**: Task scheduling and execution
3.  **hyperswitch_connectors**: Payment processor integrations
4.  **diesel_models**: Database models and ORM
5.  **api_models**: API request and response models
6.  **storage_impl**: Database access and persistence
7.  **redis_interface**: Redis client and utilities
8.  **common_utils**: Shared utility functions and helpers
9.  **router_env**: Environment management, logging, and metrics
10. **drainer**: Background processing for database operations from Redis streams
11. **masking**: Protection of sensitive information and PII

Each crate documentation aims to cover:
- Purpose and responsibilities
- Architecture and design patterns
- Key components and workflows
- Integration with other crates
- Performance and security considerations

**Additional Progress**: 
- Documentation has been completed for `hyperswitch_domain_models`, `common_enums`, `common_types`, `router_derive`, `cards`, `payment_methods`, and `currency_conversion` crates (2025-05-20), following the same comprehensive structure as the original 11 crates.
- Documentation has been added for `events`, `pm_auth`, and `external_services` crates (2025-05-20), covering their purpose, architecture, key components, implementation details, and integration with other crates.
- Documentation has been completed for the `connector_configs` crate (2025-05-27), providing comprehensive details on connector configuration management, authentication types, and integration with payment processors.
- Documentation has been completed for the `euclid` crate (2025-05-27), detailing the Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for payment routing rules, including parsing, validation, compilation, and execution components.
- Documentation has been completed for the `hyperswitch_constraint_graph` crate (2025-05-27), explaining the framework for modeling and validating domain-specific constraints using a graph-based approach.
- Documentation has been completed for the `euclid_macros` crate (2025-05-27), describing the procedural macros that enhance the Euclid DSL functionality, including the EnumNums derive macro and knowledge procedural macro.
- Documentation has been completed for the `euclid_wasm` crate (2025-05-27), providing details on the WebAssembly bindings for the Euclid DSL that enable browser-based interactions with the payment routing rules engine.
- Documentation has been completed for the `kgraph_utils` crate (2025-05-27), covering utilities for constructing and working with knowledge graphs with a focus on payment routing validation.
- Documentation has been completed for the `test_utils` crate (2025-05-27), describing the Postman collection runner and utilities for testing connector integrations using Newman.
- Implemented proactive file size management for the `router` crate documentation (2025-05-20), splitting the monolithic overview into a hierarchical structure with dedicated sections for modules, flows, architecture, and configuration. This implementation serves as a template for future documentation organization of complex crates.
- Work continues on documenting the remaining crates as identified in the finalization review.

### Documentation Structure
The documentation maintains a hierarchical structure:
- Core files in `memory-bank/`.
- Thematic documentation in `memory-bank/thematic/`.
- Crate-specific documentation in `memory-bank/thematic/crates/`.

Following the file size management guidelines established in the `.clinerules` file, complex documentation is now being split into focused files following established patterns:
- **Hierarchical Splitting**: Used for `router` crate documentation, creating a parent overview with child documents for detailed topics.
- **Topic-Based Splitting**: Applied when documentation covers multiple distinct topics.
- **Temporal Splitting**: Used for separating current and historical information.

This approach ensures that documentation remains maintainable, focused, and within the optimal size range for AI model processing.
