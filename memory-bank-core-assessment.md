   - Ensure alignment with current codebase version

## Recommendations

1. **Link Verification**:
   - Perform a comprehensive link audit across all documents
   - Update or create any missing linked documents
   - Standardize link paths (relative vs. absolute)

2. **Documentation Completion**:
   - Complete any sections marked as "TBD" in crateIndex.md
   - Create missing crate documentation
   - Verify that all aspects of the system are covered

3. **Format Standardization**:
