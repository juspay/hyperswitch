  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
</a>
Juspay, founded in 2012, is a global leader in payment orchestration and checkout solutions, trusted by 400+ leading enterprises and brands worldwide. Hyperswitch is Juspay's new generation of composable, commercial open-source payments platform for merchant and brands. It is an enterprise-grade, transparent and modular payments platform designed to provide digital businesses access to the best payments infrastructure.

Here are the key components of Hyperswitch that deliver the whole solution:

* [Hyperswitch Backend](https://github.com/juspay/hyperswitch): Hyperswitch backend enables seamless payment processing with comprehensive support for various payment flows - authorization, authentication, void and capture workflows along with robust management of post-payment processes like refunds and chargeback handling. Additionally, Hyperswitch supports non-payment use cases by enabling connections with external FRM or authentication providers as part of the payment flow. The backend optimizes payment routing with customizable workflows, including success rate-based routing, rule-based routing, volume distribution, fallback handling, and intelligent retry mechanisms for failed payments based on specific error codes.

* [SDK (Frontend)](https://github.com/juspay/hyperswitch-web): The SDK, available for web, [Android, and iOS](https://github.com/juspay/hyperswitch-client-core), unifies the payment experience across various methods such as cards, wallets, BNPL, bank transfers, and more, while supporting the diverse payment flows of underlying PSPs. When paired with the locker, it surfaces the user's saved payment methods.    

* [Control Center](https://github.com/juspay/hyperswitch-control-center): The Control Center enables users to manage the entire payments stack without any coding. It allows the creation of workflows for routing, payment retries, and defining conditions to invoke 3DS, fraud risk management (FRM), and surcharge modules. The Control Center provides access to transaction, refund, and chargeback operations across all integrated PSPs, transaction-level logs for initial debugging, and detailed analytics and insights into payment performance.

### 1. Local Setup

You can run Hyperswitch on your system using Docker compose after cloning this repository. 

```shell
git clone --depth 1 --branch latest https://github.com/juspay/hyperswitch
cd hyperswitch
docker compose up -d
```

Check out the [local setup guide][local-setup-guide] for a more details on setting up the entire stack or component wise. This takes 15-mins and gives the following output 
```shell

### 2. Deployment on cloud

The fastest and easiest way to try Hyperswitch on AWS is via our CDK scripts

1. Click on the following button for a quick standalone deployment on AWS, suitable for prototyping.
   No code or setup is required in your system and the deployment is covered within the AWS free-tier setup.

   <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/new?stackName=HyperswitchBootstarp&templateURL=https://hyperswitch-synth.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/hs-starter-config.yaml"><img src="https://github.com/juspay/hyperswitch/blob/main/docs/imgs/aws_button.png?raw=true" height="35"></a>

2. Sign-in to your AWS console.

3. Follow the instructions provided on the console to successfully deploy Hyperswitch. This takes 30-45mins and gives the following output 

| Service| Host|
|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| App server running on                        | `http://hyperswitch-<host-id.region>.elb.amazonaws.com` |
| HyperloaderJS Hosted at                      | `http://<cloudfront.host-id>/0.103.1/v0/HyperLoader.js` |
| Control center server running on             | `http://hyperswitch-control-center-<host-id.region>.elb.amazonaws.com`, Login with Email: `test@gmail.com` |
| Hyperswitch Demo Store running on            | `http://hyperswitch-sdk-demo-<host-id.region>.elb.amazonaws.com` |
| Logs server running on                       | `http://hyperswitch-logs-<host-id.region>.elb.amazonaws.com`, Login with username: `admin`, password: `admin` |

We support deployment on GCP and Azure via Helm charts which takes 30-45mins. You can read more at [Hyperswitch docs](https://docs.hyperswitch.io/hyperswitch-open-source/deploy-on-kubernetes-using-helm). 

### 3. Hosted Sandbox

You can experience the product by signing up for our [hosted sandbox](https://app.hyperswitch.io/). The signup process accepts any email ID and provides access to the entire Control Center. You can set up connectors, define workflows for routing and retries, and even try payments from the dashboard.
