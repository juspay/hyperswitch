Orca is a **_Payment Switch_** that lets you connect with **multiple payment processors with a single API integration**.
Once integrated, you can add new payment processors and route traffic effortlessly.
Using Orca, you can:

- Reduce dependency on a single processor like Stripe
- Control & customize your payment flow with 100% visibility
- Reduce processing fees through smart routing
- Improve conversion rate with dynamic routing
- Expand your business reach with new payment methods
- Reduce development & testing efforts of adding new processors

_Orca is wire-compatible with top processors like Stripe making it easy to integrate._

## Quick Start Guide

### Try It Out

**Step 1:** Use [**Orca Sandbox**](https://orca-test-app.netlify.app/) to create your account and test payments.
Please save the API key for the next step.

**Step 2:** Import our [**Postman Collection**](https://www.getpostman.com/collections/63d0d419ce1d1140fc9f) using the link below.
(Please use the API key auth type.)

```

### Installation Options

**Option 1:** Self-hosting with **Docker Image**.
_(This option is coming soon!!)_

**Option 2:** Setup dev environment using **Docker Compose**:

1. [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

2. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/juspay/orca.git
   ```

   You might need to create a [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.4/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) if you are prompted to authenticate.
   Use the generated PAT as the password.

3. [Optional] Configure your settings in [docker_compose.toml](./config/docker_compose.toml)

4. Run the application and create an account:

   1. Build and run Orca using Docker Compose:

      ```bash
      docker compose up -d
      ```

   2. Run database migrations:

      ```bash
      docker compose run orca-server bash -c "cargo install diesel_cli && diesel migration --database-url postgres://db_user:db_pass@pg:5432/orca_db run"
      ```

   3. Verify that the Orca server is up by checking your local server health:

      ```bash
      curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:8080/health'
      ```

   4. Create your Merchant Account and get your account information:

      ```bash
      bash ./scripts/create_merchant_account.sh
      ```

#### Configure & Test

5. Configure & test using your API key:

   1. Add your Connector API keys in [`keys.conf`](./keys.conf) file.
      You can fetch API keys from the Connector's Dashboard (say Stripe/Adyen/Checkout dashboard).

   2. Configure the connector in your dev environment:

      ```bash
      bash ./scripts/create_connector_account.sh <connector_name> <your Orca merchant_id>
      ```

      Use the Orca merchant ID generated from the previous step.

   3. Run a health check for your local server:

      ```bash
      curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:8080/health'
      ```

   4. Update the below command with your Orca API key and perform a test transaction.
      Refer our [Postman collection](https://www.getpostman.com/collections/63d0d419ce1d1140fc9f) to test more features (refunds, customers, payment methods etc.,)

      ```bash
      export API_KEY="<your api-key>"
      curl --location --request POST "http://localhost:8080/payments" \
      --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
      --header "Accept: application/json" \
      --header "api-key: ${API_KEY}" \
      --data-raw '{
      "amount": 6540,
      "currency": "USD",
      "confirm" :true,
      "return_url": "https://juspay.io",
      "payment_method": "card",
      "payment_method_data": {
         "card": {
            "card_number": "4000056655665556",
            "card_exp_month": "10",
            "card_exp_year": "25",
            "card_holder_name": "John Doe",
            "card_cvc": "123"
         }
      }
      }'
      ```

**Option 3:** Local setup:

a. [For MacOS](/INSTALL_macos.md)

b. [For Linux](/INSTALL_linux.md)

<!-- 4. Install with **Setup Script**

    a. Clone the repository
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/juspay/orca.git
    ```

    b. Execute script
    ```
    install orca.sh
    ```

    b. Create your Merchant Account
    ```
    create_merchant_account.sh
    ```

    c. [Configure & Test](#configure--test-the-setup) the setup using the api-key generated in Step 2 -->

### Fast Integration for Stripe Users

If you are already using Stripe, integrating with Orca is fun, fast & easy.
Try the steps below to get a feel for how quick the setup is:

1. Download Stripe's [demo app](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/quickstart)
2. Change server and client SDK dependencies in your app
3. Change API keys in your App
4. [Configure & Test](#configure--test)

## Join us in building ORCA

### Our Belief

**We believe payments should be open, fast and cheap.**

Orca would allow everyone to quickly customize and set up an open payment switch, while giving a unified experience to your users, abstracting away the ever shifting payments landscape.

The Orca journey starts with a payment orchestrator.
It was born from our struggle to understand and integrate various payment options/payment processors/networks and banks, with varying degrees of documentation and inconsistent API semantics.

### Contributing

This project is created and currently maintained by [Juspay](https://juspay.io/juspay-router).

We welcome contributions from the open source community.
Please read through our [contributing guidelines](contrib/CONTRIBUTING.md).
Included are directions for opening issues, coding standards, and notes on development.

Important note for Rust developers: We aim for contributions from the community across a broad range of tracks.
Hence, we have prioritized simplicity and code readability over purely idiomatic code.
For example, some of the code in core functions (e.g. `payments_core`) is written to be more readable rather than being pure-idiomatic.
