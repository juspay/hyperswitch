<summary><h2> What Can I Do with Hyperswitch?</h2></summary>

Hyperswitch offers a modular, open-source payments infrastructure designed for flexibility and control. Apart from our Payment Suite offering, this solution allows businesses to pick and integrate only the modules they need on top of their existing payment stack ‚Äî without unnecessary complexity or vendor lock-in.

Each module is independent and purpose-built to optimize different aspects of payment processing.

## Quickstart 

<h3> Local Setup via Docker </h3>

```bash
# One-click local setup

git clone --depth 1 --branch latest https://github.com/juspay/hyperswitch

cd hyperswitch

scripts/setup.sh
```
<details>
  <summary><strong>This script: </strong></summary>

  - Detects Docker/Podman  
  - Offers multiple deployment profiles:
    - **Standard**: App server + Control Center  
    - **Full**: Includes monitoring + schedulers  
    - **Minimal**: Standalone App server  
  - Provides access links when done

  If you need further help, check out our [video tutorial](https://docs.hyperswitch.io/hyperswitch-open-source/overview/unified-local-setup-using-docker).  

  üëâ After setup, [configure a connector](https://docs.hyperswitch.io/hyperswitch-open-source/account-setup/using-hyperswitch-control-center#add-a-payment-processor) and [test a payment](https://docs.hyperswitch.io/hyperswitch-open-source/account-setup/test-a-payment).
</details>


<h3>Hosted Sandbox (No Setup Required)</h3>

Hyperswitch offers a fully hosted sandbox environment that requires no setup. You can explore the Control Center, configure payment connectors, and test payments directly from the UI.
