-- Your SQL goes here
-- The below query will lock the merchant connector account table
-- Running this query is not necessary on higher environments
-- as the application will work fine without these queries being run
-- This query should be run only after the new version of application is deployed
ALTER TABLE merchant_connector_account DROP CONSTRAINT merchant_connector_account_pkey;

-- Use the `merchant_connector_id` column as primary key
-- This is not a unique column, but in an ideal scenario there should not be any duplicate keys as this is being generated by the application
-- So this query should not fail for not null or duplicate values reasons
ALTER TABLE merchant_connector_account
ADD PRIMARY KEY (merchant_connector_id);
