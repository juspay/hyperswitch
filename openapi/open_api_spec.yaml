    ## Get started

    Juspay Router provides a collection of APIs that enable you to process and manage payments. Our APIs accept and return JSON in the HTTP body, and return standard HTTP response codes</a>.

    You can consume the APIs directly using your favorite HTTP/REST library.

    We have a testing environment referred to "sandbox", which you can setup to test API calls without affecting production data.

    ### Base URLs

    Use the following base URLs when making requests to the APIs:

      | Environment   |      Base URL                                        |
      |---------------|------------------------------------------------------|
      | Sandbox       | <https://sandbox-router.juspay.io>                   |
      | Production    | <https://router.juspay.io>                           |

    # Authentication

    When you sign up for an account, you are given a secret key (also referred as api-key). You may authenticate all API requests with Juspay server by providing the appropriate key in the request Authorization header.

    Never share your secret api keys. Keep them guarded and secure.
