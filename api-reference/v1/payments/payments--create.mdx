<Callout type="warning" title="Deprecation Notice: Customer Upsert via Payment Requests">
Passing customer details in PaymentsRequest currently triggers an implicit upsert behavior—creating a customer if one does not exist, or updating the existing customer during payment processing. This behavior is **deprecated** and is **not recommended for new integrations**.

**Recommended Approach**

Use the dedicated Customer APIs to explicitly manage customer data before initiating payments.

- Customer APIs: https://api-reference.hyperswitch.io/v1/customers

**Why This Change?**

Moving customer management out of the payment flow provides:
- Clear separation between customer lifecycle management and payment processing  
- Predictable and consistent customer data during payment execution

Use the dropdown on the top right corner of the code snippet to try out different payment scenarios.
