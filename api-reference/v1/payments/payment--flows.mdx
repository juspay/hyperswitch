## One-Time Payment Patterns

### 1. Instant Payment (Automatic Capture)
**Use Case:** Simple, immediate payment processing

**Endpoint:**
`POST /payments`

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Hyperswitch
    participant Processor
    
    Client->>Hyperswitch: POST /payments<br/>{confirm: true, capture_method: "automatic"}
    Hyperswitch->>Processor: Authorize + Capture
    Processor-->>Hyperswitch: Payment Complete
    Hyperswitch-->>Client: Status: succeeded
```

**Required Fields:**
- `confirm: true`
- `capture_method: "automatic"`
- `payment_method`

**Final Status:** `succeeded`

### 2. Two-Step Manual Capture
**Use Case:** Deferred settlement (e.g., ship before charging)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Hyperswitch
    participant Processor
    
    Client->>Hyperswitch: POST /payments<br/>{confirm: true, capture_method: "manual"}
    Hyperswitch->>Processor: Authorize Only
    Processor-->>Hyperswitch: Authorization Hold
    Hyperswitch-->>Client: Status: requires_capture
    
    Note over Client: Ship goods, then capture
    
    Client->>Hyperswitch: POST /payments/{id}/capture
    Hyperswitch->>Processor: Capture Funds
    Processor-->>Hyperswitch: Capture Complete
    Hyperswitch-->>Client: Status: succeeded
```

**Flow:**
1. **Authorize:** `POST /payments` with `capture_method: "manual"`
2. **Status:** `requires_capture`
3. **Capture:** `POST /payments/{payment_id}/capture`
4. **Final Status:** `succeeded`

### 3. Fully Decoupled Flow
**Use Case:** Complex checkout journeys with multiple modification steps. Useful in headless checkout or B2B portals where data is filled progressively.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Hyperswitch
    
    Client->>Hyperswitch: POST /payments<br/>(Create Intent)
    Hyperswitch-->>Client: payment_id + client_secret
    
    Client->>Hyperswitch: POST /payments/{id}<br/>(Update: customer, amount, etc.)
    Hyperswitch-->>Client: Updated Intent
    
    Client->>Hyperswitch: POST /payments/{id}/confirm<br/>(Final Confirmation)
    Hyperswitch-->>Client: Status: succeeded/requires_capture
    
    opt Manual Capture
        Client->>Hyperswitch: POST /payments/{id}/capture
        Hyperswitch-->>Client: Status: succeeded
    end
```

**Endpoints:**
- **Create:**
  `POST /payments`
- **Update:**
  `POST /payments/{payment_id}`
- **Confirm:**
  `POST /payments/{payment_id}/confirm`
- **Capture:**
  `POST /payments/{payment_id}/capture` (if manual)

### 4. 3D Secure Authentication Flow
**Use Case:** Enhanced security with customer authentication

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Hyperswitch
    participant Customer
    participant Bank
    
    Client->>Hyperswitch: POST /payments<br/>{authentication_type: "three_ds"}
    Hyperswitch-->>Client: Status: requires_customer_action<br/>+ redirect_url
    
    Client->>Customer: Redirect to 3DS page
    Customer->>Bank: Complete 3DS Challenge
    Bank-->>Hyperswitch: Authentication Result
    Hyperswitch->>Hyperswitch: Resume Payment Processing
    Hyperswitch-->>Client: Status: succeeded
```

**Additional Fields:**
- `authentication_type: "three_ds"`

**Status Progression:** `processing` → `requires_customer_action` → `succeeded`

## Payment Method Management

### 1. Saving Payment Methods

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["Payment Request"] --> B["Add setup_future_usage"]
    B --> C{"Usage Type"}
    C -->|"off_session"| D["For Recurring/MIT"]
    C -->|"on_session"| E["For Customer-Present"]
    D --> F["payment_method_id Returned"]
    E --> F
```

**During Payment Creation:**
- Add `setup_future_usage: "off_session"` or `"on_session"`
- Include `customer_id`
- **Result:** `payment_method_id` returned on success

**Understanding `setup_future_usage`:**
- **`on_session`**: Use when the customer is actively present during the transaction. This is typical for scenarios like saving card details for faster checkouts in subsequent sessions where the customer will still be present to initiate the payment (e.g., card vaulting for e-commerce sites).
- **`off_session`**: Use when you intend to charge the customer later without their active involvement at the time of charge. This is suitable for subscriptions, recurring billing, or merchant-initiated transactions (MITs) where the customer has pre-authorized future charges.

### 2. Using Saved Payment Methods

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Hyperswitch
    
    Client->>Hyperswitch: POST /payments/create<br/>{customer_id}
    Hyperswitch-->>Client: client_secret
    
    Client->>Hyperswitch: GET /customers/payment_methods<br/>{client_secret, publishable_key}
    Hyperswitch-->>Client: List of payment_tokens
    
    Client->>Hyperswitch: POST /payments/{id}/confirm<br/>{payment_token}
    Hyperswitch-->>Client: Payment Result
```

**Steps:**
1. **Initiate:** Create payment with `customer_id`
2. **List:** Get saved cards via `GET /customers/payment_methods`
3. **Confirm:** Use selected `payment_token` in confirm call

### PCI Compliance and `payment_method_id`
Storing `payment_method_id` (which is a token representing the actual payment instrument, which could be a payment token, network token, or payment processor token) significantly reduces your PCI DSS scope. Hyperswitch securely stores the sensitive card details and provides you with this token. While you still need to ensure your systems handle `payment_method_id` and related customer data securely, you avoid the complexities of storing raw card numbers. Always consult with a PCI QSA to understand your specific compliance obligations.

## Recurring Payment Flows

### 3. Customer-Initiated Transaction (CIT) Setup

```mermaid
graph TD
    A["CIT Setup"] --> B{"Setup Type"}
    B -->|"With Charge"| C["Amount > 0<br/>setup_future_usage: off_session"]
    B -->|"Zero Dollar Auth"| D["Amount: 0<br/>payment_type: setup_mandate"]
    C --> E["payment_method_id"]
    D --> E
```

**Option 1 - Setup with Charge:**
- `setup_future_usage: "off_session"`
- `amount > 0`

**Option 2 - Zero Dollar Authorization:**
- `setup_future_usage: "off_session"`
- `amount: 0`
- `payment_type: "setup_mandate"`

### 4. Merchant-Initiated Transaction (MIT) Execution

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Merchant
    participant Hyperswitch
    participant Processor
    
    Note over Merchant: Subscription billing trigger
    
    Merchant->>Hyperswitch: POST /payments<br/>{off_session: true, recurring_details}
    Hyperswitch->>Processor: Process with saved payment_method_id
    Processor-->>Hyperswitch: Payment Result
    Hyperswitch-->>Merchant: Status: succeeded
```

**Required Fields:**
- `off_session: true`
- `recurring_details: {
        "type": "payment_method_id",
        "data": "<from_setup>"}`

**Use Case:** Subscription charges, scheduled billing without customer interaction

## Status Flow Summary

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> RequiresConfirmation
    RequiresConfirmation --> Processing: confirm=true
    Processing --> RequiresCustomerAction: 3DS needed
    RequiresCustomerAction --> Processing: 3DS complete
    Processing --> RequiresCapture: manual capture
    Processing --> Succeeded: automatic capture
    RequiresCapture --> Succeeded: capture API call
    RequiresCapture --> PartiallyCaptured: partial capture
    PartiallyCaptured --> [*]
    Succeeded --> [*]
    Processing --> Failed: payment failed
    Failed --> [*]
```

## Notes

- **Terminal States:** `succeeded`, `failed`, `cancelled`, `partially_captured` are terminal states requiring no further action
- **Capture Methods:** System supports `automatic` (funds captured immediately), `manual` (funds captured in a separate step), `manual_multiple` (funds captured in multiple partial amounts via separate steps), and `scheduled` (funds captured automatically at a future predefined time) capture methods.
- **Authentication:** 3DS authentication automatically resumes payment processing after customer completion
- **MIT Compliance:** Off-session recurring payments follow industry standards for merchant-initiated transactions
