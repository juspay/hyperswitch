The **Hyperswitch Payments API** enables businesses to **accept, process, and manage payments seamlessly**. It supports the entire **payment lifecycle**—from creation to capture, refunds, and disputes—allowing smooth integration of **various payment methods** into any application with minimal complexity.

### How to try your first payment through hyperswitch?
