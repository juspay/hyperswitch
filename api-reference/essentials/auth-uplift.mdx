title: Authorization Uplift
---

Authorization uplift is the practice of improving payment approval rates through intelligent error handling rather than blind retry attempts.

## Understanding Payment Failures

When a payment fails, Hyperswitch receives detailed error signals from multiple sources:
- **Issuer (Bank)**: The cardholder's bank provides specific decline reasons
- **Card Network**: Visa and Mastercard provide merchant advice codes and recommendations
- **PSP / Gateway**: The payment service provider adds connector-specific error context

## Smart Retry Strategy

By analyzing these error signals, Hyperswitch enables merchants to:
- **Identify retryable transactions**: Know exactly which payments can succeed if retried and when
- **Avoid futile retries**: Prevent unnecessary retry attempts that will never succeed
- **Provide actionable guidance**: Give clear next steps to both customers and support teams
- **Maintain network compliance**: Follow card network guidelines for retry behavior

## Error Details Structure

Hyperswitch now returns a structured `error_details` object for failed payments.

This object combines error information from the connector (PSP), the issuer (bank), and Hyperswitch's own interpretation.

### unified_details

This section is Hyperswitch's understanding of the failure. It is created by looking at the issuer and connector error signals and mapping them to a standard meaning.

#### category

The high-level unified error code (for example `UE_1000` for payment method issues).

#### message

Standardized, human-readable error message that is consistent across different connectors.

#### standardised_code

Code that identifies the specific cause for a failure within a broader error category such as `INVALID_EXPIRY_DATE`.

#### description

A detailed description of the error intended for debugging, analytics, and support teams.

#### user_guidance_message

A user-friendly message that can be safely displayed to the customer. This message provides guidance on what the user should do to resolve the issue.

#### recommended_action

A field that tells merchants what action to take after a payment failure.

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `do_not_retry` | Never retry with same card |
| `retry_later` | Retry after some time |
| `retry_after_1_hour` | Retry after 1 hour |
| `retry_after_24_hours` | Retry after 24 hours |
| `retry_after_2_days` | Retry after 2 days |
| `retry_after_4_days` | Retry after 4 days |
| `retry_after_6_days` | Retry after 6 days |
| `retry_after_8_days` | Retry after 8 days |
| `retry_after_10_days` | Retry after 10 days |
| `retry_after_instrument_update` | Retry after updating payment details |
| `retry_with_different_payment_method_data` | Use different payment method |
| `stop_recurring` | Stop recurring payments |

## Unified Error Codes and Messages

The following table maps standardised codes to their unified error codes, messages, and guidance:
