# API Key Types in Hyperswitch

Hyperswitch supports multiple API key types, each designed for different authentication and authorization use cases.

<Note>
For security, **never expose secret or admin keys in client-side or mobile code**. Use publishable keys for public contexts.
</Note>

## 1. API Key (Secret Key)

- **Primary merchant authentication key for server-side API requests.**
- Environment-specific prefix (`snd_`, `prod_`, etc.).
- Used to authenticate backend requests.
- This key can be **generated and managed from the [Hyperswitch dashboard (sandbox)](https://app.hyperswitch.io/developers?tabIndex=1)**.

- **Never expose this key in public code.**

## 2. Admin API Key

- **Administrative key** with elevated privileges.
- Used for system-level operations such as creating merchant and connector accounts.
- **Set as a configuration value when deploying or running the server.**
- Should only be used in secure, internal workflows.
- Some API calls require an admin API key. **Do not confuse this with a regular API Key.**
- The **admin API key is a configuration value that can be set at the time of deploying the Hyperswitch server**.
- **Admin API keys for the hosted Hyperswitch environments (sandbox/production) are managed by Juspay and are not provided publicly.**

<Check>
You do **not** generate this key from the dashboard.  
Instead, **set your Admin API Key in your deployment configuration**:

**For Docker Compose:**  
Update the value in your `docker_compose.toml` file:
</Check>

```toml
# docker_compose.toml
admin_api_key = "your_admin_key_here"
```
<Check> **For Helm Chart deployments:** Set the admin API key in your `values.yaml` file. </Check>

```yaml
# values.yaml
adminApiKey: your_admin_key_here
```
<Note> Do **not** expose your admin API key publicly. Only trusted operators and infrastructure should have access to this value. </Note>

You can also add a link to the Docker Compose example for extra clarity:
[See example in the Hyperswitch repository](https://github.com/juspay/hyperswitch/blob/main/config/docker_compose.toml)


## 3. Publishable Key

- **Client-side key** with limited permissions.
- Safe for use in public client-side (web or mobile) code.
- Prefix: `pk_{environment}_{uuid}`.
- Generated during merchant account creation.

## 4. Ephemeral Key

- **Temporary key** for limited operations.
- Used for single or short-lived access (e.g., accessing a specific customer object).
- Validity is configurable (see `[eph_key] validity` in `development.toml`).

## 5. JWT Key

- **Bearer token** (JWT) for API authentication and session management.
- Used for JWT-based endpoints and user authentication flows.
- Format: `Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>`
- Some API calls will require a JWT or bearer token.

<Check>
JWTs are not provisioned from the Hyperswitch dashboard.  
They are typically **issued as part of an authentication flow**, such as login or session creation.  
Check your authentication provider or the specific Hyperswitch API endpoint documentation for how to obtain a JWT.
</Check>

```http
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```
<Note> Keep your JWT tokens secure. Do not expose them in client-side code unless specifically required for session management, and always use HTTPS when transmitting JWTs. </Note>

## Reference Table

<Table>
| Key Type         | Example Prefix        | Usage                        | Security                |
|------------------|----------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Secret (API Key) | snd_c69***, prod_*** | Backend server API requests  | Keep secret             |
| Admin API Key    | (admin-specific)     | Admin operations             | Highly confidential     |
| Publishable Key  | pk_snd_3b3***        | Client-side, public usage    | Safe to expose          |
| Ephemeral Key    | (short-lived)        | Temporary, limited access    | Short validity, limited |
| JWT Key          | (JWT Bearer)         | Session/user authentication  | Use in headers          |

## Connector Authentication Keys

For payment connector integrations, Hyperswitch supports additional auth types (not for general API use):

- **HeaderKey**
- **BodyKey**
- **SignatureKey**
- **MultiAuthKey**

These are used for connector authentication and are not required for typical merchant integrations.
