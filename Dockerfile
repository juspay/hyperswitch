#
# Incremental compilation is useful as part of an edit-build-test-edit cycle,
# as it lets the compiler avoid recompiling code that hasn't changed. However,
# on CI, we're not making small edits; we're almost always building the entire
# project from scratch. Thus, incremental compilation on CI actually
# introduces *additional* overhead to support making future builds
# faster...but no future builds will ever occur in any given CI environment.
#
# See https://matklad.github.io/2021/09/04/fast-rust-builds.html#ci-workflow
# for details.
