# Memory Bank Documentation Management Project PRD

## Project Overview

The Memory Bank is a critical documentation repository for the Hyperswitch payment processing system. It serves as the central knowledge base that captures the architecture, components, workflows, and implementation details of the system. This PRD outlines the requirements for completing, organizing, and maintaining the Memory Bank documentation.

## Current State Assessment

The Memory Bank currently has a well-established structure with:
- Core files (projectbrief.md, productContext.md, activeContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md, progress.md)
- Thematic directories for crate-specific documentation
- Documentation for major subsystems like the router, connectors, and services

However, there are gaps in the documentation, inconsistencies in formatting, and a need for better organization and review processes.

## Project Goals

1. Complete all core Memory Bank documentation files
2. Ensure comprehensive documentation for all critical crates
3. Establish consistent documentation standards and templates
4. Implement a systematic review and update process
5. Create a documentation testing and validation mechanism
6. Manage documentation file sizes according to established guidelines

## Documentation Requirements

### Core Documentation

1. **Project Brief**: Complete and finalize the project brief document
   - Must include project vision, goals, and scope
   - Should be concise and provide a high-level overview
   - Must link to more detailed documentation

2. **System Patterns**: Update and enhance the system patterns documentation
   - Document all architectural patterns used in the system
   - Include diagrams for complex patterns
   - Provide examples of pattern implementations

3. **Technical Context**: Ensure technical context is comprehensive
   - Document all technologies, languages, and frameworks
   - Include dependency information
   - Document development environment setup

4. **Active Context**: Keep active context updated
   - Document current development focus
   - Track ongoing initiatives
   - Highlight areas undergoing changes

### Thematic Documentation

1. **Crate Documentation**: Complete documentation for all crates
   - Each crate must have an overview.md
   - Document public interfaces and their usage
   - Include internal architecture where appropriate
   - Document integration points with other crates

2. **Router Documentation**: Enhance router documentation
   - Complete all flow documentation (payment, refund, webhook)
   - Document configuration options
   - Document extension points

3. **Connector Documentation**: Improve connector documentation
   - Document connector interface requirements
   - Provide implementation examples
   - Document testing approaches

### Documentation Process

1. **Documentation Templates**: Create and standardize templates
   - Develop templates for different documentation types
   - Ensure consistent structure across documents

2. **Review Process**: Establish documentation review workflow
   - Define review criteria
   - Create review checklists
   - Document approval process

3. **File Size Management**: Implement file size management practices
   - Maintain documentation within size limits
   - Split large files appropriately
   - Create index files for split documentation

## Technical Requirements

1. **Markdown Format**: All documentation must be in Markdown format
   - Use standard Markdown syntax
   - Include proper headings, lists, and code blocks
   - Use Mermaid for diagrams where appropriate

2. **File Organization**: Follow established directory structure
   - Core files in memory-bank root
   - Thematic folders for specialized documentation
   - Archive folder for outdated documentation

3. **Cross-Referencing**: Implement proper cross-referencing
   - Use relative links between documents
   - Maintain a link structure that supports navigation
   - Avoid broken links

## Task Organization

The project should be organized into the following high-level tasks:

1. **Documentation Inventory and Gap Analysis**
   - Assess current documentation completeness
   - Identify missing or outdated documentation
   - Prioritize documentation needs

2. **Core Documentation Completion**
   - Update and finalize all core documents
   - Ensure consistency across core documents
   - Validate cross-references

3. **Crate Documentation Completion**
   - Complete documentation for all crates
   - Standardize crate documentation format
   - Validate technical accuracy

4. **Flow and Process Documentation**
   - Document all system flows
   - Create sequence diagrams for complex flows
   - Document error handling and edge cases

5. **Documentation Process Implementation**
   - Establish documentation review workflow
   - Create templates and guidelines
   - Implement file size management

6. **Documentation Testing and Validation**
   - Validate all documentation links
   - Test documentation completeness
   - Ensure documentation meets standards

## Completion Criteria

The Memory Bank Documentation project will be considered complete when:

1. All core documentation files are complete and up-to-date
2. All crates have comprehensive documentation
3. All system flows are documented with diagrams
4. Documentation process and templates are established
5. All documentation adheres to file size guidelines
6. Documentation has been reviewed and approved

## Priorities

1. **High Priority**:
   - Complete core documentation files
   - Document critical crates (router, hyperswitch_interfaces)
   - Establish documentation review process

2. **Medium Priority**:
   - Document remaining crates
   - Create templates and standards
   - Implement file size management

3. **Lower Priority**:
   - Create advanced diagrams
   - Optimize cross-referencing
   - Create documentation indexes

## Dependencies

- Core documentation must be completed before thematic documentation
- Documentation templates should be created before extensive documentation work
- File size management should be implemented as documents grow

## Timeline

The Memory Bank Documentation project should be completed in phases:

1. Phase 1: Documentation inventory and core files (1-2 weeks)
2. Phase 2: Critical crate documentation and templates (2-3 weeks)
3. Phase 3: Remaining documentation and process implementation (2-3 weeks)
4. Phase 4: Testing, validation, and finalization (1-2 weeks)

## Success Metrics

1. 100% of core documentation files completed
2. 100% of crates with overview documentation
3. 90% of system flows documented with diagrams
4. All documentation files within size limits
5. All documentation passing review checks
