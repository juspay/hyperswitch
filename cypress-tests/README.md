## Quick Start

For experienced users who want to get started quickly:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/juspay/hyperswitch.git
cd hyperswitch/cypress-tests
npm ci
# connector_id must be replaced with the connector name that is being tested (e.g. stripe, paypal, etc.)
CYPRESS_CONNECTOR="connector_id" npm run cypress:ci
```

## Getting Started

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (18.x or above)
- npm or yarn
- [Hyperswitch development environment](https://github.com/juspay/hyperswitch/blob/main/docs/try_local_system.md)

> [!NOTE]
> To learn about the hardware requirements and software dependencies for running Cypress, refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/app/get-started/install-cypress).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository and switch to the project directory:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/juspay/hyperswitch.git
   cd hyperswitch/cypress-tests
   ```

2. Install Cypress and its dependencies to `cypress-tests` directory by running the following command:

   ```shell
   npm ci
   ```

   Once installed, verify the installation by running:

   ```shell
    npx cypress --version
   ```

   To learn about the supported commands, execute:

   ```shell
   npm run
   ```

3. Set up the cards database:

   ```shell
   psql --host=localhost --port=5432 --username=db_user --dbname=hyperswitch_db --command "\copy cards_info FROM '.github/data/cards_info.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;"
   ```

4. Set environment variables for cypress

   ```shell
   export CYPRESS_CONNECTOR="connector_id"
   export CYPRESS_BASEURL="base_url"
   export DEBUG=cypress:cli
   export CYPRESS_ADMINAPIKEY="admin_api_key"
   export CYPRESS_CONNECTOR_AUTH_FILE_PATH="path/to/creds.json"
   ```

> [!TIP]
> It is recommended to install [direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv) and use a `.envrc` file to store these environment variables with `cypress-tests` directory. This will make it easier to manage environment variables while working with Cypress tests.

> [!NOTE]
> To learn about how `creds` file should be structured, refer to the [example.creds.json](#example-credsjson) section below.

## Running Tests

Execution of Cypress tests can be done in two modes: Development mode (Interactive) and CI mode (Headless). The tests can be executed against a single connector or multiple connectors in parallel. Time taken to execute the tests will vary based on the number of connectors and the number of tests. For a single connector, the tests will take approximately 07-12 minutes to execute (this also depends on the hardware configurations).

For Development mode, the tests will run in the Cypress UI where execution of tests can be seen in real-time and provides a larger area for debugging based on the need. In CI mode (Headless), tests run in the terminal without UI interaction and generate reports automatically.

### Development Mode (Interactive)

```shell
npm run cypress
```

### CI Mode (Headless)

```shell
# All tests
npm run cypress:ci

# Specific test suites
npm run cypress:payments            # Payment tests
npm run cypress:payment-method-list # Payment method list tests
npm run cypress:payouts             # Payout tests
npm run cypress:routing             # Routing tests
```

### Execute tests against multiple connectors or in parallel

1. Set additional environment variables:

   ```shell
   export PAYMENTS_CONNECTORS="payment_connector_1 payment_connector_2 payment_connector_3 payment_connector_4"
   export PAYOUTS_CONNECTORS="payout_connector_1 payout_connector_2 payout_connector_3"
   export PAYMENT_METHOD_LIST=""
   export ROUTING=""
   ```

2. In terminal, execute:

   ```shell
   source .env
   ../scripts/execute_cypress.sh
   ```

   Optionally, `--parallel <jobs (integer)>` can be passed to run cypress tests in parallel. By default, when `parallel` command is passed, it will be run in batches of `5`.

## Test reports

The test reports are generated in the `cypress/reports` directory. The reports are generated in the `mochawesome` format and can be viewed in the browser.
These reports does include:

- screenshots of the failed tests
- HTML and JSON reports

## Folder structure

The folder structure of this directory is as follows:

```

## Adding tests

### Addition of test for a new connector

1. Include the connector details in the `creds.json` file

2. Add the new connector details to the ConnectorUtils folder (including CardNo and connector-specific information).

   To add a new Payment connector, refer to [`Stripe.js`](cypress/e2e/PaymentUtils/Stripe.js) file for reference.
   To add a new Payout connector, refer to [`Adyen.js`](cypress-tests/cypress/e2e/PayoutUtils/Adyen.js) file for reference.

   **File Naming:** Create a new file named <connector_name>.js for your specific connector.

   **Include Relevant Information:** Populate the file with all the necessary details specific to that connector.

   **Handling Unsupported Features:**

   - If a connector does not support a specific payment method or a feature:
   - The relevant configurations in the `<connector_name>.js` file can be omitted
   - The handling of unsupported or unimplemented features will be managed by the [`Commons.js`](cypress/e2e/PaymentUtils/Commons.js) file, which will throw the appropriate `unsupported` or `not implemented` error

3. In `Utils.js`, import the new connector details

4. If the connector has a specific redirection requirement, add relevant redirection logic in `support/redirectionHandler.js`

### Developing Core Features or adding new tests

#### 1. Create or update test file

To add a new test, create a new test file in the `e2e` directory under respective `service`. The test file should follow the naming convention `000<number>-<Service>Test.cy.js` and should contain the test cases related to the service.

```javascript
// cypress/e2e/<Service>Test/NewFeature.cy.js
import * as fixtures from "../../fixtures/imports";
import State from "../../utils/State";

describe("New Feature", () => {
  let globalState;

  before(() => {
    cy.task("getGlobalState").then((state) => {
      globalState = new State(state);
    });
  });

  after("flush global state", () => {
    cy.task("setGlobalState", globalState.data);
  });

  it("tests new functionality", () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

#### 2. Add New Commands

```javascript
// cypress/support/commands.js
Cypress.Commands.add("newCommand", (params, globalState) => {
  const baseUrl = globalState.get("baseUrl");
  const apiKey = globalState.get("apiKey");
  const url = `${baseUrl}/endpoint`;

  cy.request({
    method: "POST",
    url: url,
    headers: {
      "api-key": apiKey,
    },
    body: params,
  }).then((response) => {
    // Assertions
  });
});
```

### Managing global state

The global state is used to share data between tests. The global state is stored in the `State` class and is accessible across all tests. Can only be accessed in the `before` and `after` hooks.

## Debugging

### 1. Interactive Mode

- Use `npm run cypress` for real-time test execution
- View request/response details in Cypress UI
- Use DevTools for deeper debugging

### 2. Logging

```javascript
cy.task("cli_log", "Debug message");
cy.log("Test state:", globalState.data);
```

### 3. Screenshots

- Automatically captured on test failure
- Custom screenshot capture:

```javascript
cy.screenshot("debug-state");
```

### 4. State Debugging

- Add state logging in hooks:

```javascript
beforeEach(() => {
  cy.log("Current state:", JSON.stringify(globalState.data));
});
```

### 5. Hooks

- If the `globalState` object does not contain latest data, it must be due to the hooks not being executed in the correct order
- Add `cy.log(globalState)` to the test case to verify the data in the `globalState` object

> [!NOTE]
> Refer to the Cypress's official documentation for more information on hooks and their execution order [here](https://docs.cypress.io/app/core-concepts/writing-and-organizing-tests#Hooks).

### 6. Tasks

- Use `cy.task` to interact with the Node.js environment
- Task can only be used in `support` files and `spec` files. Using them in files outside these directories will result in unexpected behavior or errors like abrupt termination of the test suite

## Linting

To run the formatting and lint checks, execute the following command:

```shell
# Format the code
npm run format

# Check the formatting
npm run format:check

# Lint the code. This wont fix the logic issues, unused imports or variables
npm run lint -- --fix
```

## Best Practices

1. Use the global state for sharing data between tests
2. Implement proper error handling
3. Use appropriate wait strategies
4. Maintain test independence
5. Follow the existing folder structure
6. Document connector-specific behaviors
7. Use descriptive test and variable names
8. Use custom commands for repetitive tasks
9. Use `cy.log` for debugging and do not use `console.log`

      "api_secret": "api_secret"
    }
  }
}
```

### Multiple credential support

- There are some use cases where a connector supports a feature that requires a different set of API keys (example: Network transaction ID for Stripe expects a different API Key to be passed). This forces the need for having multiple credentials that serves different use cases
- This basically means that a connector can have multiple credentials
- At present the maximum number of credentials that can be supported is `2`
- The `creds.json` file should be structured to support multiple credentials for such connectors. The `creds.json` file should be structured as follows:

```json
{
  "connector_name": {
    "connector_1": {
      "connector_account_details": {
        "auth_type": "SignatureKey",
        "api_key": "api_key",
        "key1": "key1",
        "api_secret": "api_secret"
      }
    },
    "connector_2": {
      "connector_account_details": {
        "auth_type": "SignatureKey",
        "api_key": "api_key",
        "key1": "key1",
        "api_secret": "api_secret"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Dynamic configuration management

- `Configs` is the new `object` that is introduced to manage the dynamic configurations that are required for the tests
- This is supposed to be passed in an exchange (configuration for a specific can be passed to a test based on the need and this will impact everywhere in the test execution for that connector)
- At present, only 3 configs are supported:
  - `DELAY`: This is used to introduce a delay in the test execution. This is useful when a connector requires a delay in order to perform a specific operation
  - `CONNECTOR_CREDENTIAL`: This is used to control the connector credentials that are used in the test execution. This is useful only when a connector supports multiple credentials and the test needs to be executed with a specific credential
  - `TRIGGER_SKIP`: This is used to skip a test execution (preferably redirection flows). This is useful when a test is does not support a specific redirection flow and needs to be skipped
- Example: In order to refund a payment in Trustpay, a `DELAY` of at least `5` seconds is required. By passing `DELAY` to the `Configs` object for Trustpay, the delay will be applied to all the tests that are executed for Trustpay

```json
{
  "Configs": {
    "DELAY": {
      "STATUS": true,
      "TIMEOUT": 15000
    }
  }
}
```
