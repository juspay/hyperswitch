## Overview
This Tool is a solution designed to automate testing for the [Hyperswitch](https://github.com/juspay/hyperswitch/) using Cypress, an open-source tool capable of conducting API call tests and UI tests. This README provides guidance on installing Cypress and its dependencies.

   ```
3. Clone the repository and switch to the project directory:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/juspay/hyperswitch
   cd cypress-tests
   ```
4. Set environment variables for cypress

   export CYPRESS_ADMINAPIKEY="admin_api_key"
   ```

5. Run Cypress test cases
    To run the tests in a browser in interactive mode run the following command
